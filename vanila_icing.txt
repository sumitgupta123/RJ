Question: where will HEAD be pointing to?

Question: Who cares?

icing
Let's try another commit

Make sure your HEAD is in icing (How?)

    gedit vanilla_icing.txt
    #Remember to stage and then commit
    ls
    git checkout master
    ls
    #Question: where did icing.txt go?

 

vanilla_icing.txt


Ingredients
3 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 to 2 tablespoons milk

Steps

    1.    In medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with spoon or electric mixer on low speed. Stir in vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the milk.
    2.    Gradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too thick, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time. If frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of powdered sugar. Frosts 13x9-inch cake generously, or fills and frosts an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake.

 

Checkout does two things:

-It moves your HEAD

-It changes your working directory
